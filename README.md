## My Notes

### Why I took this course?

**Application design and code structure**

For me, the most challenging part of learning Go was in structuring my
application. Go doesn't prescribe any particular project layout or application
structure.

Every Go application I've ever worked on appears to have a different answer to
the question, _how should I organize my code?_

This course taught me patterns and simple rules that I've found to be helpful in
architecting Go applications that can results in making Go code more
maintainable -- decouple our code, make it easier to test, and consistent
project structure.

Application design and code organization is one of the hardest problems about
writing software and it rarely gets the focus it deserves.
